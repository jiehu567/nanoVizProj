                <p>The bar plot show how strong each of the attributes of a soccer player associates with overall rating in general. We can see: reaction, potential, age, short_passing, and long_passion are top 5 indicators for a high-rating soccer player. The height, however, performs pretty low correlation to overall ratings.</p>
                <p>
                If mouseover the bar, we can see how the types of attributes distributed. (The types are defined by <a href="http://sofifa.com/players/top"> EA FIFA</a>).

                <ul>
                  <li>Personality attributes, like potential and age, are strongest indicator to overall rating</li>
                  <li>Power, mentality and skill attributes are more significant to indicate overall rating</li>
                  <li>Defending attributes locate at bottom of plot. They are less attractive</li>
